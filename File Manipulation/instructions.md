# File Manipulation
A script to manage files.

## Requirements
For this challenge, write a script to do the following:

- Prompt the user to choose one of the following options
    1. Create an empty file
    2. Write text to a file (create if not exists)
    3. Exit
- Prompt the user for the name of file to create/edit, and create the file
- If required prompt the user for text to write to file, and write it to the file
- Prompt the user to press ENTER to go back to the start menu

This process should repeat until the user stops the script with the menu option or CTRL+C. \
Your script should also include error handling, you never know what the user will do, and how your code will react.

When you're done, compare your code to [mine](fileController.py). \
Assess what you did well, and what you could do better.

## Resources
I can't stop you from just Googling how to do this, but that won't help you learn!

[W3 Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/python/default.asp) is a great resource for almost any programming language.

## Tips, tricks, and best practices
1. If you find yourself repeating code, define a function for it.
2. Avoid putting if statements inside of other if statements, never nest!
3. If you get stuck, take a step back. Try to list in order the steps your script should follow, and go from there.
4. Command line scripts look best in an empty terminal, clear it!
