# Learn Python!
Learning a new programming language can be hard, but Python is a great beginner language!

## Where do I start?
Within this repository there are multiple folders, within which you'll find different Python challenges designed to be good for beginners. 

Each folder has a file called `instructions.md` which lays out the requirements, resources, and tips for completing each challenge. ***Read that first!***

Also in each folder is a Python file. These are my own personal takes on each of the challenges. You can compare yours to mine to see how you did!

That's it, pick a challenge and give it your best shot!
